== Short Bio
I am currently a Ph.D. student at the [https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/v1/ Department of Computer Science] of [https://www.hkbu.edu.hk/ Hong Kong Baptist University], supervised by [https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~renjiewan/ Dr. WAN, Renjie]. I obtained my bachelor's degree and master's degree in Communication Engineering from the School of Information and Communication Engineering at [https://www.uestc.edu.cn/ University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)] in 2019 and 2022, respectively. I am also a research intern at NVIDIA AI Technology Center since Sep 2022.\n

My research interests include Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), adversarial attack and defence, and AI security.
