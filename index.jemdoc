== About me

I am currently a Ph.D. student at [http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/ Multimedia Lab (MMLab)], the Chinese University of Hong Kong. I am supervised by [https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~hsli/ Prof.Hongsheng Li]. I received my bachelor's degree in Network Engineering from the School of Information  and Communication Engineering at [https://www.uestc.edu.cn/ University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)] in 2019. Now, I am also a Research intern at [https://www.sensetime.com/cn/ SenseTime X-Lab], working closely with  [http://liuyu.us/ Yu Liu] and [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bd3v08QAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN/ Guanglu Song].\n

My research interests include deep learning and its applications on face recognition and video understanding.
