== Short Bio
I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/v1/ Department of Computer Science] at
[https://www.hkbu.edu.hk/ Hong Kong Baptist University], supervised by [https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~renjiewan/ Dr. WAN, Renjie].
I obtained my bachelor's degree and master's degree in Communication Engineering from
the School of Information and Communication Engineering at [https://www.uestc.edu.cn/ University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)]
in 2019 and 2022, respectively. Since September 2022, I have also been a research intern at NVIDIA AI Technology Center.\n

My research interests include neural radiance fields, implicit neural representations, digital watermarking, and inverse problems.
